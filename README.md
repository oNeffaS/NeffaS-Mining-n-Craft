## New Tools

### - **Scrap Tools**

![](https://i.imgur.com/v4MFmMA.png)

Unlocked right after stone tools, scrap tools provide an intermediate option for survivors seeking efficiency without the resources needed for iron and steel.

- **Scrap Pickaxe:** Good for common ores like iron and copper, the scrap pickaxe offers a decent option before you progress to iron.
- **Scrap Axe:** Ideal for cutting down trees and demolishing barricades. Durable, but not as effective as steel.
- **Scrap Shovel:** Versatile and efficient for digging dirt and sand, the scrap shovel is a solid tool for gathering surface materials.

### - **Titanium Tools**

Unlocked after steel tools, titanium tools are the best in terms of durability and lightness. These tools are the right choice for tackling the toughest challenges in mining and resource gathering.

- **Titanium Pickaxe:** Perfect for breaking high-hardness ores like cobalt and titanium, providing high efficiency without loss of durability.
- **Titanium Axe:** Cuts wood with ease and is extremely lightweight, making it the best tool for gathering wood and destroying barricades.
- **Titanium Shovel:** Provides fast and efficient digging, perfect for advanced players who need to excavate large areas quickly.

### - **Motor Tools**

Motor-powered tools are the pinnacle of mining in *NeffaS' Mining & Craft*, with the **Jackhammer** and the **Vanilla Drill** offering distinct specializations.

- **Jackhammer:** Ideal for mining large quantities of rocky minerals like stone and rock. The jackhammer is the perfect tool for breaking rocks quickly and efficiently, making large-scale mining more accessible in the late game.
  
- **Vanilla Drill:** Has been adjusted to have its damage to rocks reduced, making it more effective for mining metals. This creates a clear distinction between the two tools: the **Drill** is ideal for extracting metal ores, while the **Jackhammer** is optimized for gathering rocky minerals.

This separation allows both tools to be useful in the endgame, with each playing a crucial role in ensuring you obtain the resources you need more efficiently.

## Smelting System

The smelting system has been expanded and enhanced, introducing new materials, tools, and mechanics.

### Vanilla Forge

![](https://i.imgur.com/F2C8uOz.png)
  
The Vanilla Forge can now smelt the following materials:
  
- **Copper**, **Zinc**, **Quartz**, **Aluminum**, **Iron**, **Lead**, **Glass**, **Stone**, and **Clay**.

Additionally, the ***Iron Sledgehammer*** has been added as a new essential tool in the forge, replacing the ***crucible***, which is now exclusive to the new ***Advanced Forge***.

Another important change is that **Brass** will now be scrapped into **Copper**, and to craft brass, you will need to combine **Copper** and **Zinc** in the forge.

### Advanced Forge

![](https://i.imgur.com/9TmD9o5.png)

The ***Advanced Forge*** is a more specialized station, allowing the smelting of rarer and more advanced materials such as:
- **Chromium**, **Cobalt**, **Titanium**, in addition to all other materials accepted by the Vanilla Forge.

This forge requires specific tools to optimize smelting time:
- **Forge Tongs**: Reduce smelting time by 25%.
- **Forge Grinder**: Reduces crafting time by 25%.

### Interface Adjustments
- **Recipe Slot Expansion**: Recipes now support up to **6 ingredient slots**, allowing for greater complexity and combination of items.
- **Updated Crafting Skill Window**: The crafting skill window interface has been adjusted to accommodate the **6 ingredient slots**, offering a better viewing and usage experience.

### Recipe Adjustments
- Most recipes involving **ores** have been revised to reflect the new mining and crafting mechanics. **Ingredients have been added or changed** to maintain consistency with the new material and progression system, ensuring more balanced gameplay.

### Loot and Trading Adjustments
- **New ores and their derivatives** have been properly integrated into the game's loot system. This includes the chance to find the new materials in containers and structures on the map.
- Traders have also been adjusted to **sell and trade** all the new ores and derived items, ensuring that players can find these resources both by exploring and buying.
