### Ore Integration and Crafting Recipes

All minerals have been properly added to the map's spawn points and have been integrated as accepted materials in forges. This ensures that every mineral is available for use throughout the game. 

Please note that crafting recipes will only be updated upon the project's completion. Until then, the current recipes will remain unchanged.
